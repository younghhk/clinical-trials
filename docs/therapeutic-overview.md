# Overview of Therapeutic Clinical Trials

Clinical research studies can be grouped into therapeutic and non therapeutic trials.

Therapeutic trials give a treatment to participants to study its effect on a disease. These studies help evaluate safety, effectiveness, and how a treatment should be used in practice.

Non therapeutic trials do not provide a treatment. They collect information that improves scientific understanding, such as risk factors, biomarkers, or patient experiences.

## Phases of Therapeutic Trials

- **Phase I** focuses on safety and dose evaluation.
- **Phase II** evaluates whether the treatment shows benefit in a specific patient group.
- **Phase III** compares the new treatment with the current standard to determine whether outcomes improve.

These phases guide how promising treatments progress toward clinical use.
